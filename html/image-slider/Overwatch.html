       It seems like only yesterday that Overwatch hit retail after a lengthy beta phase, but in the last six months or so we've seen plenty of updates in the form of new heroes, maps and even new gameplay modes. Whether you've been part of the action since the very earliest Alpha days but have since taken a break, or you're coming to the game completely new, there's now a huge amount of gameplay information to wrap your head around. If you've found yourself sticking to a handful of the same heroes since launch, it can also be hard to expand your repertoire and find a new niche to master.
       <br>
Taking all of the above into account, we thought it would probably be pretty useful for the playerbase at large if we put together a beginner's guide, one which contained an overview of everything you could possibly need to know about each hero, what mastering every map entails, and how you might go about gaining the upper hand when it comes to mastering all of the objectives in Overwatch. Regardless of your experience with the game, we think even at this stage of Overwatch's life there should be something new for everyone to discover from this hub.
<br>

As well as helping total newcomers by providing a very broad overview of all things Overwatch, we've also made sure there are clear links out to all of our other guide content as well: heroes, maps, team builds and more. If you want to dig deeper into a particular area of the game, make sure you check these other articles out while you're here. They each contain detailed information that's guaranteed to make you a better Overwatch player, and much more quickly than if you just dive in without any knowledge of the hero or map in question.
<br>
We think the end result should be a pretty robust starter guide all things considered, but if there's a topic that you think we should be covering, then we'd love you to let us know in the comments section so we can look at adding it in. We consider even the biggest of our guides on the site to be a work-in-progress, and we'll continue updating every article in the months and years ahead, and to reflect the very latest developments in Overwatch's massive and ever-changing metagame.
<br>
Overwatch has 23 live heroes at the time of publication, with a pretty broad spread of characters across four distinct categories: Offense, Defense, Support and Tank. Despite their rough classifications, each one of these character brings something very different to the table as a result of their unique abilities - abilities which define how each one plays. Some characters also do a better job of directly countering other heroes in battle, and the real art of war lies in blending the right heroes together for the current map.
<br>
Here's a quick run-through of who's who in the Overwatch universe, and what you can expect when you play each one. Check the individual links for our guides to each Hero, as every one of these special features is guaranteed to give you the edge in battle.
<br>
If you're not sure which Hero to start with, take a look through our pick of the best Overwatch Heroes for beginners. Our Overwatch counters guide will also help you pick a solution for every problem!

All the maps in Overwatch
<br>
At the time of writing this article, there are 15 different maps in Overwatch, separated into four very distinct gameplay modes. Here's the lowdown on how each one plays.
<br>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<h1>Location</h1>
<br>
Hanamura (Assault): Set in Japan, Hanamura was one of the original maps of the beta game and includes plenty of sniping spots and hidey-holes - Hanamura guide
<br>
Temple of Anubis (Assault): Stairways and overpasses define the Temple of Anubis, and team combat often finds you first... - Temple of Anubis guide
<br>
Volskaya Industries (Assault): The industrial Volskaya favours tanky characters due to the wide open spaces available to snipers - Volskaya Industries guide
<br>
Ecopoint Antarctica (Arcade): Mei's spiritual home is only available for a handful of unique modes in the Overwatch Arcade - Ecopoint Antarctica guide
<br>
Ilios (Control): A Control map with objectives set around crisp white villas - Ilios guide
<br>
Lijiang Tower (Control): Lijang Tower is a Control map set in a bustling Chinese metropolis - Lijiang Tower guide
<br>
Nepal (Control): On this map, teams compete to control zones set within an ancient Nepalese monastery - Nepal guide
<br>
Oasis (Control): Overwatch's desert-themed map features the game's first jump pad - Oasis guide
<br>
Dorado (Escort): One of the prettiest maps in the game, Dorado provides plenty of hiding spots for trapping the unwary - Dorado guide
<br>
Watchpoint: Gibraltar (Escort): Stuffed with hiding spots and bottlenecks, this is a tricky map to master - Watchpoint: Gibraltar guide
<br>
Route 66 (Escort): Overwatch's homage to the classic American highway - Route 66 guide
<br>
Eichenwalde (Hybrid): A castle assault map that represents the first new battleground to hit the game since launch - Eichenwalde guide

<br>
Numbani (Hybrid): There are balconies galore on Numbani, just waiting for industrious snipers to take up their position - Numbani guide
<br>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<h1>Overwatch's game modes</h1>
<br>
At the time of publication there were four different game modes available in Overwatch: Assault, Control, Escort and Hybrid. Here's a quick overview of how each one works - check the individual guides for specific advice for how to play Offense, Defense, Tank and Support Heroes on each one.
<br>
Assault - Here, the teams are once again in Attacking and Defending roles, with the former team attempting to capture specific objectives, while the latter does its best to stop them from taking them! - Assault guide
<br>
Control - On a Control map, both teams compete to take control of objectives in a best-of-three series of rounds. Once a team has been in the vicinity of a control point for long enough, their progress meter will increase. When it fills up completely, the point is considered their's and the next round begins - Control guide
<br>
Escort - When it comes to Payload maps, the task is somewhat different. Here, an Attacking team must stay in close proximity to a payload in order to keep it moving towards its delivery point. The Defending team does their best to halt the progress. Maps have timers but checkpoints apply - Escort guide coming soon!
<br>
Hybrid - Hybrid maps are a mixture of Assault and Escort modes. First an attacking team must push forwards and claim a control point, then they must escort a Payload towards its destination. A fun mix-up of the two modes which demands a great deal of flexibility when it comes to switching in and out of Heroes - Hybrid guide coming soon!
<br>
Once you've upgraded your Career Profile to Level 25 by playing Quick Play matches, you'll be able to participate in Competitive Play. In this mode, you'll fight to level up through the ranks each season to unlock exlucive rewards. 
<br>
<div class="line"></div>
<br>
<h1>Loot and levelling in Overwatch</h1>
<br>
There's no pay-to-win element in Overwatch, and nothing to unlock beyond purely cosmetic rewards. Each match you play rewards a certain amount of experience points (XP) depending on your performance. Earning XP allows you to level up through the ranks, and each time you hit a new rank you'll earn an Overwatch loot box.
<br>
Contained within these boxes are various cosmetic rewards, such as new voice samples, emotes and skins. What exactly you'll receive is entirely random, but any duplicates are automatically converted into Credits, which you accumulate and can then spend on unlocking specific items for your favourite Heroes.
<br>
You can also buy bundles of boxes from the in-game shop for real money if you wish. The contents will still be randomised, but again there are no pay-to-win elements here. The system instead allows people to take a shortcut towards adding some cosmetic flair to their favourite Heroes.
